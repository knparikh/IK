# Given an infinite stream of integers, everytime you encounter '404', print the top k largest numbers
# Use a min-heap, NOT a max-heap, because in max-heap you will delete the max number during insertion
# In delete min-heap, do not delete from array
# When inserting, if you find number greater than min, delete_min and insert new element
